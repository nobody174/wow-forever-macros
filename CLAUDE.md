# WoW Forever Macros

Macro cheatsheet for World of Warcraft: Forever (Classic+ on the Classic client, vanilla spell names, level cap 60).
Live site: GitHub Pages from `main` / root → https://nobody174.github.io/wow-forever-macros/

Small multi-page site: `index.html` is the countdown/landing page ("Venom & Trollmann's
Road to Forever"), `macros.html` is the macro cheatsheet, `builds.html` lists talent
builds per class, `addons.html` lists addons. All four share a top bar (site title,
Macros / Builds / Addons / Talent Calc links, current page highlighted).

Class roster order on both `macros.html` and `builds.html` follows armor type,
Cloth → Leather → Mail → Plate: Priest, Warlock, Mage, Rogue, Shaman, Hunter,
Paladin, Warrior. Keep new classes inserted in this order on both pages.

## Files
- `data.py` — single source of truth for every macro. Edit macros HERE only.
- `template.html` — HTML/CSS/JS shell (shared top bar + macro cheatsheet UI);
  `__DATA__` is replaced with the macro JSON at build time, `__PAGE_MACROS__` /
  `__PAGE_BUILDS__` / `__PAGE_ADDONS__` are replaced with `aria-current="page"` markers.
- `build.py` — generates `macros.html` and `wow-forever-macros.md` from `data.py` +
  `template.html`.
- `macros.html`, `wow-forever-macros.md` — generated output. Never hand-edit; run
  `python build.py`.
- `index.html` — hand-written landing page. Hero background (`assets/hero.webp`),
  title, countdown to the WoW Forever launch, and the visitor's local launch time via
  `Intl.DateTimeFormat`. Countdown target: `2026-11-04T23:00:00Z`. Left-side overlay
  (`.side-links`) has three link "plaques": Zockify, a Cozy Sleeping Bag plaque
  (icon + description + a sub-link to the quest-chain guide), and Dungeon Loot Tables.
  Hand-edit directly.
- `builds.html` — hand-written page with one talent-build card per class (icons +
  hover tooltips, arrows between picks — see `builds_page_pattern` project memory
  for the exact pattern). Hand-edit directly.
- `addons.html` — hand-written page listing the addons Venom & Trollmann actually run
  (ForeverPlus, Platynator, Leatrix Maps, Forever Bag Mover — all CurseForge links,
  verified working) plus a link to wow4ever.quest's addon compatibility tracker.
  Hand-edit directly.
- `assets/hero.webp` — landing page hero background (dwarf/gnome group in front of
  Frostforge Pass gate, nameplates "Venom" and "Trollmann" over the two dwarves).
  Generated via local ComfyUI (SDXL base + inpainting), finalized with Pillow
  (crop/resize to 2560×1080, nameplate overlay in Cinzel, exported as WebP < 500KB).
- `assets/sleepingbag.webp` — small icon (256×256) for the Cozy Sleeping Bag overlay
  plaque on `index.html`. Generated via local ComfyUI (SDXL base txt2img), finalized
  with Pillow (resize, exported as WebP).
- `assets/universal-icon.webp` — roster icon for the "Universal" tab on `macros.html`
  (dwarf+bear emblem, self-hosted from wow4ever.quest's own logo, converted to WebP).
  Class roster icons (Priest/Shaman/Paladin/Warlock/Hunter/Warrior/Rogue/Mage) are
  NOT local assets — they're hotlinked from Wowhead's icon CDN (`wow.zamimg.com`)
  directly in `template.html`'s `CLASS_ICONS` map.
- `assets/drafts/` — gitignored scratch folder for image-generation drafts/
  intermediates (hero and icon art both land here). Not part of the deployed site.

## Workflow
1. Macro changes: edit `data.py` (or `template.html` for cheatsheet layout/top bar
   changes), then run `python build.py`.
2. Landing/builds page changes: hand-edit `index.html` / `builds.html` directly.
3. Check every macro is <= 255 characters.
4. Test locally with `python -m http.server` before pushing.
5. Commit with a clear message and push to `main` (Pages redeploys in ~1 minute).
6. The moment something ships, move it out of `BACKLOG.md`/`ROADMAP.md` and into
   `CHANGELOG.md` — see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md)
   (Shape B: BACKLOG is the active todo list, ROADMAP is the someday bucket).

## Macro style rules (strict)
- Short, one-liners whenever possible. No bloated conditions.
- DPS, Priest only (needs target-of-target): `/cast [@targettarget, harm, exists][harm] SPELL`
- DPS, every other class (Shaman/Paladin/Warlock/Hunter/Warrior/Rogue — no TT needed):
  `/cast [harm] SPELL`
- Heal/utility (friendly only): `/cast [@mouseover, help, exists][help] SPELL`
- Friend-or-foe spells (e.g. Dispel Magic): `/cast [@mouseover, exists][exists] SPELL`
- Buffs: `/cast [@mouseover, help, exists][help][@player] SPELL`
- Spam-safe channels (Warlock): `/cast [@targettarget, harm, exists, nochanneling][harm, nochanneling] SPELL`
  — chan() keeps TT; only the dps() helper was split by class, chan()/stance() were not.
- Focus: `/cast [@focus, harm, exists][harm] SPELL`
- Wand (must stay exactly two lines, never use !Shoot):
  ```
  /cast [@targettarget, harm, exists, nochanneling:Shoot] Shoot
  /cast [harm, nochanneling:Shoot] Shoot
  ```
- Melee: `/startattack [@targettarget, harm, exists][harm]`
- Hunter Auto Shot is the one exception that uses `!Auto Shot`.
- No ranks in spell names (highest rank casts automatically).
- All code and comments in English.

## Structure in data.py
Each class has a "Shared" section (all specs) plus spec sections. Macro types:
Damage / offensive, Mouseover healing / utility, Cleanse / dispel, Wand / auto-attack,
Buffs, Panic / defensive, Targeting helpers, Class QoL, Focus, Misc / UI.
Misc / UI lives only in the UNIVERSAL block (camera/UI console commands, target
marking, gear-swap macros — not spell-specific, so not part of any class section).
Classes: Priest, Shaman, Paladin, Warlock, Hunter, Warrior, Rogue, Mage.
Use helpers: dps() (Priest only — target-of-target-aware), dpsHarm() (every other
class — plain [harm] targeting, no TT), heal(), util(), buff(), chan(), foc(),
plain(), me(), stance(). Every helper prepends #showtooltip; hand-written
multi-line /cast or /castsequence macros must add #showtooltip as their own
first line. Pure utility commands (/console, /tm, /target, /focus, /petattack,
/use item) do not get #showtooltip.
