# Backlog

Active todo list — what's next, known gaps, findings not yet acted on. Shape B:
everything not shipped yet lives here, whether started or not. The moment
something ships, it moves to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), not left here as a
stale checkmark.

## Open findings (from the 2026-09-24 WoW role pass)

- **Weapon-swap macro doesn't mention the combat restriction.** WoW blocks weapon
  swaps while in combat (a hard game rule, not a macro bug) — the site's
  description doesn't say this, so a player could try it mid-fight and be
  confused why nothing happens. Explicitly declined a fix when raised; revisit
  if it turns out to actually confuse people.
- **No arena/PvP-specific macro coverage.** No `arena1-3` unit tokens or
  stopcasting patterns anywhere, though focus-based interrupt/CC macros exist.
  Confirmed out of scope for now — this site is general-purpose/PvE-leaning per
  its own lede. Revisit only if PvP macro requests actually come in.
- **`/console` CVar combat-lockdown status not fully confirmed.** Verified via a
  live WoW Forever community post that `/console` macros work on this client
  (not a stale Classic assumption) — but whether any are specifically blocked
  in combat wasn't confirmed either way. Low priority: none of the current
  `/console` macros (zoom, hide guild/PvP names) are combat-relevant actions.

## Ideas not yet built

- Addons page: expand beyond the current 4-addon list as Venom & Trollmann adopt
  more addons for launch.
- Builds page: still a coming-soon placeholder — needs actual talent build
  content once specs are locked in closer to November 4.
- Consider whether `assets/hero.webp`'s six-hero composite is worth another
  refinement pass (spell-effect colors read as mostly torch-glow rather than
  distinct lightning/ice/shield colors) — parked because the current version
  was accepted as good enough, not because it's blocked.
